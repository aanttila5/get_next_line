Plan:
read a file into a *char until new line or end of BUFFER_SIZE
if new line: return
if BUFFER_SIZE is up then save what's read into the *char and start reading again to look for the new line
return once new line found
*char should be a static variable
HOW DO I READ INTO A *CHAR UNTIL BUFFER_SIZE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S IN IT???
